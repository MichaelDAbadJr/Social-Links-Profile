## My process
I used the figma design to extract measurements such as the font, text size, text weight, padding, margin, and gaps, etc. 

### Built with
CSS Reset:
Including margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; ensures a consistent design across browsers.

Root Variables:
Using :root for color variables is excellent for scalability and maintainability. It makes it easier to update the theme or reuse colors.

Typography:
The Google Font Outfit is applied consistently, and the font weights (400 and 700) are preloaded for performance optimization.

Responsive Design:
Using max-width for the .card-container ensures the design remains responsive across devices.
The use of min-height: 100svh for the body ensures the card is always vertically centered in the viewport.

Semantic HTML:
Using <main> for the card container is semantically correct because it represents the main content of the page.

Flexbox:
Flexbox is used effectively for centering and aligning content, both for the overall layout and within the card.


### What I learned
I learned how to get exact measurements from the figma design. I got comfortable with extracting the details and measurements from the figma tools in order to manually write the CSS code and semantic HTML.
