## Overview
This is a simple social media card featuring a user's profile. It includes a profile image, the user's name and location, a short bio, and several social media links. The design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, and the card is styled using CSS Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness

### Users can see:
- Profile picture
- Name and Location
- A Brief bio
- Social media buttons(GitHub, Frontend Mentor, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)

## My process
I used the figma design to extract measurements such as the font, text size, text weight, padding, margin, and gaps, etc. 

### Built with
React.js

Responsive Design:
The card is fully responsive, adjusting based on screen size using media queries.

Hover Effects:
The social media buttons have hover effects that change the background and text color, providing interactive feedback.

Flexbox:
Flexbox is used effectively for centering and aligning content, both for the overall layout and within the card.

### What I learned
I learned how to get exact measurements from the figma design. I got comfortable with extracting the details and measurements from the figma tools in order to manually write the CSS code and semantic HTML.
